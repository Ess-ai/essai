        I would like to notify you on the absence of our essay marking service,
        Since I have not yet developed the AI, I trained a GPT3 model from OpenAI and Open-Assistant
        for the marking of the AI. On March 1st, I runned out of the free quota provided to me by OpenAI.
        Since this is a free service, we are in shortage of funds to purchase tokens.
        I am currently still developing the ai using models from hugging face.
        You can Support my work by buying me a coffee.
